Another hackathon, another blog post. Last weekend I have been invited to participate at BASF's Coding Chemistry hackathon at Mannheim, Germany. The topic was the butterfly effect, i.e. optimizing manufacturing output by statistical analysis.

We were using both R and Python for statistical analysis of the datasets and D3.js for plotting our results.

In the end, I had a great weekend with some awesome food and managed to improve my skills with pandas and scipy.
