FC Bayern Munich organized their [Hackdays](https://hackdays.fcbayern.com/) last weekend, a four days hackathon combined with amazing tech talks and also a soccer game of FC Bayern against Werder Bremen.

With our project we wanted to improve fan engagement. Therefore we implemented the FC Bayern FanAwards App (Android + iOS) that allows a personalized fan experience combined with daily challenges.

We implemented a hybrid app with Apache Cordova and a Node.js backend combined with different APIs such as Facebook, Twitter and Hybris. By completing daily challenges, users gave us enough data so we could provide personalized news about their favorite players, their hobbies and products they might like. Users earned points that boosted them in an overall ranking so they could earn unique prizes.
