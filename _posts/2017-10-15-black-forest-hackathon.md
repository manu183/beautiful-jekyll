Last weekend I participated in my first hackathon in Offenburg, Germany. The [Blackforest Hackthon](http://www.blackforest-hackathon.com)'s topic was to devel a digital assistent. Our goal was to develop an assistant that could recognize people via face recognition and display certain information according to the person's priorities.
