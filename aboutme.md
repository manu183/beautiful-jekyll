My name is Manuel Lang and I am Computer Science student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.

In my free time I love playing and watching sports (soccer, handball, basketball, hockey, skiing, etc.), reading books and playing around with some coding stuff. Currently I am working with TensorFlow to implement some funny things with state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms.

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just check [my linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/manuel-lang) and it will answer **all** your questions.
